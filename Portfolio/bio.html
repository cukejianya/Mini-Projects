            My name is Chinedum Moses Ukejianya. I am a failure. I wish to be like others. In a way I guess I am like others. Very few people wish not to be like others which makes me the majority. However, I am not like others. Maybe I am overwhelm by the number of intelligent people around Or maybe I cannot handle the path that geniuses who spam the history textbooks took. I want to be great. I really do. I want to be great. Just let me be just that.
